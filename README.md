<!--
Looking for a place where I can grow as a developer by
    writing maintainable code,
    architecting new systems and features,
    learning from and mentoring other developers
    -->

Looking for:
- Remote senior-level position at a software company
  - Tech Lead or Engineer
- Grow and maintain healthy code bases in production
  - As well as transforming legacy code into healthy code
- Culture:
  - Values learning
    - For example:
      - Sponsors conference talks (I have spoken at conferences and would be excited to continue to do so)
      - Dedicated time to sharing best practices learned across teams
      - Time for learning is budgeted into every engineer's schedule
      - Budget for learning resources: Books, online, conferences
  - Values tooling
    - Documentation, tests, and building/improving internal tools are not only expected, but encouraged
  - Anti-silo
- Problems I find interesting:
    - Building software that is both extensible and easy to use.
       - Designing a fuzzy finder for Neovim that allows for heavy extensibility but ease of use
    - Writing maintainable code for complex domain problems
        - Working with the user (whether a customer, client or other developer) to find out what their problem is.
        - Iterating on the design and constraints
        - Implementing a solution that solves their problem elegantly and effectively.

### Successes:

- Architected a large refactor of our core product that resulted 
  - Used Python metaclasses to make it virtually impossible to take an action on a candidate that was no longer viable.
    - the cool part is I made developers lives easy (you didn't have to think about a bunch of stuff)
    - and it resulted in happy end users, because they never sent bad emails
- Co-workers ask for my advice on technical problems and enjoy pairing with me to solve them
  - I planned and organized weekly discussions on software engineering practices and how we could implement them 
- Speaker at VimConf
  - Recording of talk has reached over 6,000 views: [Neovim Builtin LSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9X5VF9ASac)


### Credentials:

- Experience working remotely with an asynchronous team.
  - Not only professionally, but also on Neovim
- Technical lead at Sourceress:
  - Responsible for a large scale refactor of our entire candidate pipeline (the core part of our product)
