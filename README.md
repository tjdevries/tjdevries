### TJ DeVries

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m the author of [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/telescope.nvim) and a core contributor to [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

I like making plugins and making Neovim work better for me & as many people as I can :grin: You can sponsor my work at [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/tjdevries).

I also stream on here: [teej_dv](https://twitch.tv/teej_dv). 

- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to play the marimba!
